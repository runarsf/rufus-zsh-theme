# rufus-zsh-theme
A heavyweight, buggy, intense, slow, unoptimized, fun, cool ( and pretty good-looking ) oh-my-zsh theme.
It also has direct integration with runarsf/rootdo ( in the future )

## Q ( Literally no users, so I don't have FA questions ):
#### Why is it so heavyweight?
* It determines the length of the line to write as the header, and prints them out one-by-one.

## Installation:
1. Download zsh
2. Download oh-my-zsh
3. Copy 'rufus.zsh-theme' into '$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/'
4. Add or edit the value of 'ZSH_THEME' in $HOME/.zshrc to be 'ZSH_THEME="rufus"'
5. 'source ~/.zshrc'
6. Enjoy!
